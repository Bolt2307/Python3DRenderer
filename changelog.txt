Bolt2307 : 1/11/2023

+ Switched Rotation to be done with the cursor

Lrae1207 : 2/11/2023
+ Comments to describe and separate sections of code
+ Fixed class system
+ Added Vector3 class

Note: Object occlusion still needs to be implemented

Bolt2307 : 2/11/2023
+ Tried to add Z-sorting for object occlusion, did not work
+ Broke distance-based rendering in the process
+ Made background color randomize :)
+ Added comments to keep Lrae from yelling at me C:

Bolt2307 : 3/11/2023

Lrae1207 : 7/11/2023
+ Fixed idle position bounce glitch
+ Replaced clocking system (it was deprecated)
+ Added analytics display
+ Fixed pygame/math module collisions

Bolt2307 : 8/11/2023
+ Added the ability to toggle specs in pause menu with F

Bolt2307 : 9/11/2023

Lrae1207 : 15/11/2023
    + Added face pre-compilation optimization
    + Pre-calculates array of points rather than compiling each vertex just-in-time

    + F1 is now specs toggle button

Bolt2307 : 25/11/2023
